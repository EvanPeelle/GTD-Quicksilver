<!-- PURPOSE:
speed up and clearly collect/process/execute/update/track progress in a single place.DESIGNED:
depth of execution with many actions in line.[not spreading thinner with many types]
@GTD - gamify productivity - waits/done now whats/depth of action completion/ project pods - speed of work flow, simplicity of visual, / flexibility of items.
when next action is complete the action gets updated from the queue in a project object."
visualize amount of productivity at its various stages - process stage 30%, done stage 50%, etc
TODOS:

//PERSISTENCE:
//integrate with DropBox data store.
  //store first peice of data.
  //retrieve first peice of data.
    //achieve persistence. w or w/o node?

//sms message on the go events to my phone as text messages [twillio api]

//CLIENT:
//output to another page that can be speed key interacted with
